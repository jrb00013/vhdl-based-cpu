# VHDL-based CPU Design üñ•Ô∏è

This project implements a basic CPU in VHDL. It consists of essential components like the ALU, control unit, registers, and memory.

## Files:
- **cpu_top.vhd**: Main design of the CPU.
- **alu.vhd**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
- **control_unit.vhd**: Handles the control logic of the CPU.
- **register_file.vhd**: Storage for registers.
- **datapath.vhd**: Connects all the components of the CPU.
- **memory.vhd**: Simulates RAM and ROM.
- **testbench.vhd**: Used to test and validate the CPU.

## How to Compile:
1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Run `make` to compile the project.
4. Run the simulation to verify the functionality.

## Requirements:
- VHDL Compiler (e.g., ModelSim or Vivado)
