# VHDL RISC-Style CPU with Custom ISA üñ•Ô∏è

My VHDL that I built back in school, which consists of essential components like the ALU, control unit, registers, and memory.

I used Quartus Prime as my VHDL compiler but you can also use VIVADO. I also recommend pulling the repo while in your src file directory for Quartus Prime as it is the eas

## How to Compile:
1. Open the terminal man.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Update the IDE or Command Line VHDL Compiler's build path to the directory MakeFile.
4. Compile and Run with your VHDL Compiler
5. Run the simulation to verify the functionality.
6. (Optional) Deploy on an simple cheap FPGA like the DE-10 Lite, which is what I personally used.

## Requirements:
- VHDL Compiler (I used Quartus Prime. You can use VIVADO.
- ModelSim or other compatible simulation software.
